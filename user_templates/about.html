<p>This tool allows users to upload the bulk crystal structure in several standard formats (or to choose from a few
    examples), and then layered structures are identified based on geometrical criteria. Finally, after generating
    features vectors representing the crystal structure, the tool uses a machine learning model to see if the crystal
    structure can be exfoliated or have high binding energy.
</p>

<p>
    The demonstrated outcome page includes relevant information on the structure (interactive visualizations of the bulk
    multilayer) and whether the structure is suitable for exfoliation or not. If yes, the corresponding two-dimensional
    materials are displayed.

    <em>Notes</em>: 1. The tool computes representing features vectors of the crystal structure in real-time, and this
    step might take some time. 2. The tool will consider two atoms A and B bonded if their distance is smaller than
    <em>r<sub>A</sub> + r<sub>B</sub> + delta </em>, where <em>r<sub>A</sub></em> and <em>r<sub>B</sub></em> are the
    corresponding van-der-Waals radii from the following paper: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C3DT50599E"
        target="_blank"></a>Alvarez, S. <em>A cartography of the van der Waals territories</em>, Dalton Trans. 42,
    8617â€“8636 (2013)</a>. For delta value, we have considered five equally spaced values between 1.1 A and 1.5 A to
    consider possible uncertainties in the values of the van-der-Waals radii.
